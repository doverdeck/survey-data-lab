# survey-data-lab
The data I chose for this lab was on responsibility of college students in relation to loan payements, graduation, school level, etc. I decided to use this data-set as I wanted to see how graduation rates and other factors related to life after college in terms of debt and what insights that may help me with. The two factors I used for my scatter plot was share of people with a completion rate above 150% the normal rate and the rate of people still with debt after 5 years. In addition to that I also calculated the median and mean for standard debt default rate, completion rate, and loans outstanding rate in comparison to the level of institution in terms of graduation time. With all this data I concluded that with the aid of the scatter plot that with a faster completion rate the students were more likely to pay of their loans in time. This data was not completely conclusive with the median and mean data, as the schools that took faster to complete didn't always have the lower debt rate. Overall, the faster completion rate in a college dependent on its original value showed trends in lowering debt; however, the lower year institutions didn't always gurantee a lower debt rate. I believe this is a cause of the faster completion rate students generally being higher acheivers, and the lacking difference in shorter year schools.
