# survey-data-lab
The data I chose for this lab was on responsibility of college students in relation to loan payements, graduation, school level, etc. I decided to use this data-set as I wanted to see how graduation rates and other factors related to life after college in terms of debt and what insights that may help me with. The two factors I used for my scatter plot was share of people with a completion rate above 150% the normal rate and the rate of people still with debt after 5 years. In addition to that I also calculated the median and mean for standard debt default rate, completion rate, and loans outstanding rate in comparison to the level of institution in terms of graduation time.
